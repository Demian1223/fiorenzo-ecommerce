  <p class="producttext ">
    Fiorenzo was created to fill a gap in Sri Lanka’s fashion landscape where access to authentic 
    international luxury brands was either limited, overpriced, or outdated in experience. 
    Inspired by the global demand for prestige combined with convenience, Fiorenzo set out to become 
    Sri Lanka’s first luxury fashion marketplace that blends authenticity, affordability, and innovation. 
    By offering world-renowned brands such as Gucci, Dior, Channel and Louis Vuitton
    along with free delivery and seasonal promotions, Fiorenzo makes high fashion more accessible 
    while preserving exclusivity and authenticity.
